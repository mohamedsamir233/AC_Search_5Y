# Ac Search Trends for 5 Years
> This project analyzes 5 years of weekly search data for Air Conditioners (AC) and uses a time series forecasting model (Prophet) to predict search trends for the next 24 months.
## 📌 Project Objectives
- Understand long-term patterns in AC search interest.
- Identify seasonal behaviors and monthly trends.
- Build a forecasting model to predict future search demand.
## 🤖 Time Series Forecasting (Prophet Model)
- Reformatted data using Prophet’s required `ds` (date) and `y` (value) structure.
- Trained a Prophet model with yearly seasonality.
- Generated future dates for the next 24 months.
- Visualized the forecast alongside historical data.
## ✅ Key Outcome
The project delivers a clear and interpretable forecast of AC search demand for the next two years, identifying seasonal peaks and long-term trends that can support business and planning decisions.
